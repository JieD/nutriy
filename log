4/6  fix issue with Google Code 
     build skeleton of reading and writing file in an efficient way
4/7  familiar with raw USDA data file format
     choose necessary data fields for my app
     clean raw file: remove db ID and delimiters
4/8  create DataHelper project for managing db
     read raw file ABBREV.txt and write to nutrition_db.txt which extracts the
     necessary fields and serving unit    
4/9  improve color combination RGB, consolidate dimension values so that no hard     value is used in layout file
     change font size to better match the screen
     add fake views for better layout
     finish NutritionTableFragment and fragment_nutrition_table.xml
     manage to dynamically change the text of TextView in the fragment
4/10 presentation preparation: slides & talk
     enable clickable views in AddEntryActivity
4/12 familiar with Mac environment
4/13 familiar with Mac environment
4/14 Navigation Drawer - add ListView and Listener
4/16 Navigation Drawer - Icon & update local environment with GoogleCode
                         color when selected, change title on ActionBar

4/23 Custom View - NutritionChartFragment
4/24 Custom View - PieChart, color, TypedArray, custom attributes
5/8  Custom View - improve color, add table, redesign the code for better structure, try to add gap between pie slices
5/9  Custom View - mathematical model for calculation offset of each slice according to its percentage (startAngle & endAngle)
5/10 Custom View - reconstruct code, create Slice class to encapsulate properties - practice DRY, better understanding of custom view and how to dynamically change properties
5/11 MainActivity - add NavigationDrawer for each Activity. 
     Reconstruct - MainActivity has Navigation Drawer, other existing Activity converts into Fragment.
     Use selector to enable only one item selected.

5/12 Convert Activity to Fragment, add proper comments.
5/14 Convert Activity to Fragment, add proper comments.
     Avoid invoking fragments from fragment. All transaction is done inside an Activity
     Enable button click programmatically due to XML way only works for Activity
     Convert AddEntry layout to be ExpandableListView to enable grouping and division 
5/15 Successfully use ExpandableListView with custom ExpandableListAdapter, expanded by default and hide group indicators
     Add click listeners
     Work on AddFragment
5/16 Clean data from USDA with appropriate unit, format and sequence
5/17 Create Nutrition and DatabaseHandler to populate the nutritions db
     Use beginTransaction() to speed up db rows insertion 
5/18 Use SQLiteStatement to speed up db rows insertion
     Read up existing code to better understand
     Fix CRUD errors
     Find way to look into Database Schema & Content - Emulator & SQLite Browser
