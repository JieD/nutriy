# Project short description #

This project is a class term project to create an android mobile application. The app's name is NutriY. NutriY allows users to create their own diet diary, and helps calculate the nutrition value and the calorie intake. The app can also provide basic meal choice advice based on current diet diary, to help balance nutrition of everyday diet. In this way, users can keep track of their daily nutrition, and be very well aware of whether their diet is healthy. It also serves as a good tool to help users accomplish their goals in controlling weight, and ultimately live a healthy lifestyle.

# Story Board #

Mary is interested in keep track of her diet and also loses weight. She downloaded the app and started setting up her account.  In addition to user name and password, she can also upload her avatar and expose her progress to her friends. (It is a good way to stimulate users working on the weight control goals.) She input her weight goal, activity level and age which help the app calculate the calorie intake goal. She can also set up her exercise goal which serves as a reminder to encourage exercising. (Mockup 1-3)

After set up the account, Mary was ready to write her first diet diary. On the front page, she clicked Diary and added food items to Breakfast. She added milk to breakfast category. The nutrition value and calorie are calculated automatically.(Mockup 4-9) She could check the overall nutrition and calorie value in Nutrition page, which is conveniently shown in both formats in table and chart. (Mockup 10-11) According to the nutrition table, Mary can tell that she needs to have more vitamins and protein in that day’s diet, because there are a lot left to accomplish for Protein and Vitamin rows.

Mary can also keep track of her weight control progress. On Progress page, she can record current day’s weight and a very nice chart is shown of her weight history. (Mockup 12)

After a few days of using the app, Mary was able to make healthy food choices, and also progressing towards her weight control goal.
